D-VAMS software has been written in HTML/Javascript/JQuery. It should be capable of running on any device with a web browser. To install:

1) Copy the DVAMS directory to a location on your device's file system

2) Navigate to the directory and locate the file "menu_home_dvams.htm". Clicking on it may automatically start it with your browser, however if it does not, you may need to select the file and find an option "open with". Select this, and a list of programs should be displayed. If there is a "make default" option, then enable this and select the name of the browser to use. 

3) When the browser opens, you should be presented with D-VAMS home page. Bookmark the page so that it is available for easy access.

4) For the latest version, download the v3.08 update "DVAMS_v308_update.zip" and overwrite the existing files in your DVAMS directory with these newer versions.

If your browser cannot browse files on your device, try the following instead:
______________________________________________________________________________

1) If you do not have a web server installed on your device, get a suitable web server app, such as 'kWS Android Web Server', or an equivalent which is compatible with the operating system of your device.

2) Find the location of you app's default ("web root") directory and copy the directory DVAMS into it.

3) Start your web server app, navigate to the DVAMS directory on your device and open the file "index.html". The browser on your device should open with the DVAMS home page and menu ("menu_home_dvams.htm"). Alternately, you can start up your browser and type in the URL "http://localhost:8080/dvams/"
